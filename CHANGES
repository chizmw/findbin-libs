Fix version-string bug in Makefile.PL

1.54 Wed Nov  9 17:00:09 CST 2011

OK, seems to make more sense if the code
uses 5.10, which is still supported.

1.53 Sun Oct  9 11:02:50 CDT 2011

oops... should have upped the module version number
when I upped the Perl version... also makes more sense
to use v-strings at this point with v5.12.

1.52 Fri Sep  9 17:10:29 EDT 2011

Add "realbin" option that bases the lookup on 
$FindBin::RealBin. This allows a command line
executable to be symlinked back to wherever it
lives and find configuration files adjacent
to the "real" file. This saves having to symlink
the configuration files next to the symlinked
executable.

Up the use to v5.10 now that 5.8 is no longer
supported.

1.51    Thu Sep  2 18:26:55 EDT 2010

Fix MANIFEST.
Internal changes.

1.43 Thu Sep  2 12:34:52 EDT 2010

Fix bug that required use=1 instead of "use" alone in 
argument processing.

Add POD for mixing git repositories using git repository
as base with  ( subdir=lib subonly ).

1.41 Sat Jun 13 23:02:36 EDT 2009

Fix errors in tests 06, 07.

1.40 Wed Jun 10 07:22:48 EDT 2009

Blindly regex the lib's before returning them
from find_libs. This avoids issues running 
tainted.

1.39 Tue Jun  9 18:14:02 EDT 2009

Remove an extraneous $DB::single.

1.38 Tue Jun  9 17:00:29 EDT 2009

Catch: "-T" doesn't like eval-ed code. 
Fix:
    require lib;
    lib->import( @lib_dirs )

It doesn't seem as though lib depends on 
the caller's namespace, so there isn't
any harm in calling it this way. Otherwise
I'll have to find some other way of working
around -T.


1.36 Mon Mar 31 19:06:25 EDT 2008

Add tests for mulitple use or require + multiple
calls to import. Check that calling import once
with a subdir followed by a second without any
arg's still gives the same results (t/0[67]).

Update Makefile.PL to use 5.00601.

1.35 Fri Mar 30 13:05:45 EDT 2007

Add additional check for broken abs_path on W32.

Update tests to add ./bin for cases where the 

O/S does not supply one.

1.34 Thu Mar 29 15:42:26 EDT 2007

Add block eval for 'abs_path' calls in the 
sub-dir checks to avoid croaking MS platforms 
(not an issue for *NIX or VMS that I can tell). 

1.33 Tue Feb  6 11:40:10 EST 2007

Add subdir and subonly to look below the ./lib
dir's for things like ../lib/perl5.

1.32 Sat Jan 20 15:58:36 EST 2007

Repair botched MANIFEST

1.31 Thu Dec  7 14:34:24 EST 2006

POD

./exmaple/p5run sets PERL5LIB and exec's whatever else
is on the command line.

MANIFEST cleanups

1.30 Thu Dec  7 14:34:24 EST 2006

Added 'p5lib' to prefix the lib's found to $ENV{ PERL5LIB }.

POD for p5lib, doc cleanups.

1.26 Tue Aug  1 12:26:13 EDT 2006

- Added Bin argument to allow overriding $FindBin::Bin
  as the root of all evil.

1.25 Fri Mar  3 08:37:49 EST 2006

- POD: using prove without a blib.

1.23 Mon Feb 27 12:49:02 EST 2006

- Fix paren bug in catpath.

- Update POD format bugs.

1.21 Wed Feb  8 16:20:44 EST 2006

- Trying to fix regex oddity on VMS...

- Use ".+" to untaint $FindBin::Bin instead of "(.+)/?".

1.20 Sun Jan 29 19:29:03 EST 2006

- Use File::Spec to split, assemble directory paths. 

- Optinally stub Cwd::abs_path if it failes to resolve
  cwd at startup.

- Replaced test.pl with t/*.t.

- POD

1.07 Thu Sep  8 09:33:29 EDT 2005

- RedHat Enterprise Version 4 has a bug that leaves $FindBin::Bin
  with a trailing slash. Fix is to regex it off before using the
  variable.

- Added "debug" argument to set $DB::single = 1 after processing
  the arguments; saves having to hack the code to test where the 
  things come from.

1.06 Sat Apr 30 00:24:23 EDT 2005

- Set print to undef -- should've been that way
  to begin with.

1.05 Thu Nov  4 17:35:31 EST 2004

- Wrap abs_path in an eval to handle systems that die on
  non-existant directories.

1.03 Wed Oct 20 12:03:30 EDT 2004

- Fix doc bug -- added /jowbloe/ below /home on the 
  sandbox examples.

1.03 Tue Oct 19 17:13:04 EDT 2004

- Update doc's to include sandbox manglement.

1.02 Thu Jun 10 14:26:53 CDT 2004

- Fix typo in version number.

1.01 Mon May 31 21:13:13 CDT 2004

- Modify the split for ignored arguments to ignore whitespace
  around the comma separators. This only applies to cases where
  the caller doesn't use qw() for the arguments and ends up 
  with something like: 'ignore=/, /foo'.

- Repair default arg's to successfully ignore '/' and
  '/usr' by default.

- Eval symlink creation to handle systems without symlinks.

  Caveat utilitor: this module has only been tested by me on
  *NIX, the assumed directory separation on '/' is most
  likely broken on ms-dos, VMS, or related filesystems. If
  any currently available *NIX lacks symlinks please warn
  me, otherwise YMMV.

- Cleaned up some comments.

1.00 Mon Mar 22 11:18:45 CST 2004

- Up the version number. Thing seems stable enough to call it
  1.00 at this point.

- Reverse the order of CHANGES, with most recent at the top.

0.18 Tue Mar 16 22:22:02 CST 2004

- Added -e test before abs_path to avoid nastygrams
  from Cwd on abs_path of dangling links.

0.17 Mon Mar  8 23:25:20 CST 2004

- Removed leftover $DB::single (d'oh...)

0.16 Sat Jan 24 14:52:23 CST 2004

- Replaced 0 with undef for default print. noprint is
  now the default.

0.15 Sat Jan 24 14:46:22 CST 2004

- POD

0.14 Wed Dec  3 12:23:42 CST 2003

- Modify Makefile.PL to use ABSTRACT_FROM, NAME entry of POD to 
  add abstract.

- Added notes to README.

- Included test for bogus directory (unless you DO have a 
  ./frobnicatorium) w/ exported array empty.

0.13 Wed Dec  3 10:12:13 CST 2003

- pod for sandbox description.

0.11 Wed Nov 26 16:08:35 CST 2003

- Fixed switch bug for handling print/noprint & verbose.
- test.pl failed on Solaris due to /bin -> /usr/bin, test
  changed to regex from eq.

0.10 Mon Nov 24 16:06:22 CST 2003

Initial release.
